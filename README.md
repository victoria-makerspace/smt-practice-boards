# SMT Practice Boards

This repository contains Surface Mount Technology(SMT) board designs that are intended to be used for training purposes.  Every SMT practice board design provides the information:  

1. bom:  Bill of Materials, including DigiKey part references.
1. gerber: files used to order PCBs from suppliers such as PCBWay or JLCPCB.
1. images:  photos of the board
1. kicad:  KiCAD schematic and layout files.  Fiducials are included on the layouts to support automatic pick and place machines.
1. schematic:  PDF schematic 
1. stencil:  DXF and LightBurn format files used to make laser cut stencils.  Laser cut stencils can be created using 4 mil mylar. 

## Rotating LEDs Practice Board
The [Rotating LEDs practice board](https://github.com/victoria-makerspace/smt-practice-boards/tree/main/board-rotating-leds) is inspired from the [Gikfun SMT training board](https://gikfun.com/collections/frontpage/products/gikfun-diy-smd-smt-welding-practice-soldering-skill-training-board)
